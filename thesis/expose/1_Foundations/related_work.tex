This section will cover approaches on efficient IND discovery. We will go over different algorithms and discuss their unique features. Further we will argue whether or not the ideas of the algorithm can be applied in a partial IND setting.

In 1995 Bell and Brockhausen \cite{bell1995discovery} propose a graph-based approach to represent the relationships between attributes, allowing for a more efficient exploration of the search space. The algorithm is initiated with a complete directed graph, wherein all possible edges are initially included. A directed edge in the graph represents an inclusion dependency, which is read as the edge from $A_i$ to $A_j$ ($A_i \rightarrow A_j$) represents the IND $A_i \subseteq A_j$. It then proceeds to remove those edges that failed the IND check. To determine the validity of an edge, the algorithm checks for transitivity, which enables it to answer whether a dependency could exist between two variables based on their relationships with a third variable, which was tested previously. If it is ascertained that a dependency is impossible, the algorithm skips the test and directly removes the given edge, thereby reducing the overall computational cost.
