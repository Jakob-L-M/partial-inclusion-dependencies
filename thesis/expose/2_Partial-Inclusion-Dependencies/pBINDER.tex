For general purpose IND discovery, \textit{BINDER} \cite{papenbrock2015divide}
is the most powerful algorithm as of writing this thesis. It still outperforms more recent approaches using competing data profiling platforms like Desbordante\footnote{https://github.com/Mstrutov/Desbordante} which are written in C++ \cite{smirnov2023fast}. It uses a divide and conquer strategy to minimize costly I/O operations and further keeps track of already invalidated INDs. As part of this thesis I will rewrite BINDER, such that it supports the discovery of partial inclusion dependencies. While rewriting the algorithm, I want to explore the occurring challenges in detail and discuss various strategies of solving them. \\
The starting point is the GitHub repository\footnote{https://github.com/HPI-Information-Systems/inclusion-dependency-algorithms} of a inclusion dependency comparison paper written by DÃ¼rsch et al. \cite{dursch2019inclusion}. To create \textit{pBINDER}, the partial version, we need to perform adjustments within the validator.
