\section{Partializing IND Algorithms}
To enable partial IND discovery for existing algorithms, we need to adjust their mechanism. These adjustment may be more or less complex, depending on the structure of the algorithm. We have chosen to partialize \textit{SPIDER} and \textit{BINDER} to understand how complex such adjustments are and how the runtime differs from the non-partial variants.
