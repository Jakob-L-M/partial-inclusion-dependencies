\subsection{Hyperparameter Optimization}
There are five hyperparameters which influence the execution of \textit{SPIND}. The size of the initially created chunks (\textit{CHUNK}), the maximal number of values which are kept in main memory during the sorting phase per thread (\textit{SORT}), the maximal number of files which are merged at once per thread (\textit{MERGE}), the queue size for each relation during candidate validation (\textit{VALIDATION}) and the degree of parallelization (\textit{PARALLEL}). Leveraging Bayesian optimization \cite{shahriari2015taking}, we seek to efficiently and iteratively identify parameter configurations that minimize the execution time of \textit{SPIND} of various datasets.
