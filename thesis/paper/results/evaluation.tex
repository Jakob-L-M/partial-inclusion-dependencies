\section{Experimental Evaluation}
To understand the practical performance of the proposed algorithms \textit{pSPIDER}, \textit{pBINDER} and \textit{SPIND} we use the known algorithms \textit{SPIDER} and \textit{BINDER} with their provided implementations. We will go over the datasets used and provide execution times for all datasets for the different algorithms. Afterwards we investigate the influence of the partiality factor $\rho$ and give a few real-world examples of pINDs.
