# Ensemble

A bio-dataset, available through the [ftp server of ensembl](https://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/). The most recent release was used which is release 111 as of writing this.

## Usage
Using the [ðŸ“œextraction script](./unpack_files.py) the compressed tsv files can easily be extracted. Every file has a header line and for each animal there are four provided schemas. [RefSeq](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/refseq/), [Entrez](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entrez), [ENA](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/home) and [UniProt](https://www.uniprot.org/).

These versions will be referenced as `RefSeq`, `Entrez`, `ENA` and `UniProt`.

Further there is the protein data which is stored in the `ðŸ“‚homologies` folder. Using the script `unpack_protein_files.py` we can create the `Protein` dataset.
