MusicBrainz is an open music encyclopedia that collects music metadata and makes it available to the public, aiming to be the ultimate source for music information where anyone can contribute, with data released under open licenses, and to serve as the universal lingua franca for music, offering a reliable and distinct means of music identification, enabling both humans and machines to engage in meaningful conversations about music. They offer a full dump of the database in varing formats, inclusing [TSV files](https://ftp.musicbrainz.org/pub/musicbrainz/data/fullexport/).

All referenced results are based on the dump from the 9th of March 2024. A more recent version will have differenting values but the found pINDs should not vary too much. The 171 files require 16.7GB of disk space.
