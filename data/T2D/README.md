## T2D v2 Gold Standard

T2D is available through [webdatacommons.org](http://webdatacommons.org/webtables/goldstandard.html). We use the second version of the gold standard. The raw files are jsons which include relational data. Use the script `extract_relational.py` to transform the json files to csv files.
